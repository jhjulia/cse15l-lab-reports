## CSE15L Lab 4: Week 7 Lab Report

### **Part 1**
To give the shortest sequence of vim commands for changing the name of the "start" parameter and its uses to "base", I used ```/start<Enter><c><g><n>base<esc><n><.><esc><n><.><esc><n><.><esc><n><:><w><q>```

> * Type ```/start<Enter>``` to search the word "start" and move to the cursor to the word.  

![image](Screenshot42.png)
> * Type ```<c><g><n>``` to delete the word "start".

> * Type ```base```

![image](Screenshot44.png)
> * Type ```<esc><n>``` to exit the insert mode and find the next "start".  

![image](Screenshot45.png)
> * Type ```<.>``` to repeat the last change

![image](Screenshot46.png)
> * Type ```<esc><n>``` to exit the insert mode and find the next "start"

![image](Screenshot47.png)
> * Type ```<.>``` to repeat the last change.

![image](Screenshot48.png)
> * Type ```<esc><n>``` to exit the insert mode and find the next "start".

![image](Screenshot49.png)
> * Type ```<.>``` to repeat the last change.

![image](Screenshot410.png)
> * Type ```<esc><n>``` to exit the insert mode and find the next "start", but in this step, there is no more "start" word.

> * Type ```<:><w><q>``` to save the changes and exit vim.
